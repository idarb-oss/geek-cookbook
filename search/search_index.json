Alltough Kubernetes with the use of Microk8s is also possible, kubernetes do also need more ram and cpu than Raspberry Pi 3 can give to be realy useful. Overview Here we will go thrue the process of setting up docker swarm on a Raspberry Pi, and joining multiple Pis to form a production grade swarm cluster. This setup can be fully headless or using an HDMI screen and USB keyboard to control nodes of your cluster. What we will do Deploy Docker on Raspberry Pi Joining multiple workers to form a cluster What we have Linux type os here we use PopOS 20.04 Minimum 2 Raspberry Pis tough we will use 3 A micro-USB power cable for each Pi (USB-C for Pi4) we have PoE Hat A USB power-supply with as many ports as you have boards A microSD card per Pi (16GB recommended), flashed with an Ubuntu Server image Setting up Each Pi will have ubuntu 20.04 LTS intalled as the OS and we will use SSH to loginto them. Prepare SD card Warning This will erase all excisitng content on the microSD card. First, we need to insert the microSD card into you're computer. To do this we fist install the Raspberry Pi imager: Raspberry Pi Imager for Ubuntu Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows Raspberry Pi Imager for macOS Once you have done this start the program and select the OS where we will pick Ubuntu 20.04. Press CHOOSE OS Scroll down and find Ubuntu You then see a list of the diffrent ubuntu os that can be installed. We will select Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (RPI 3/4/400) we need to use 64bit since its the only OS Microk8s is available for. Select the SD card to write to by pressing CHOOSE SD CARD and press WRITE then wait until its done. Boot Up With the new writen SD card put it into the Pi and plug in the ethernet cable and connect it to the power. Wait for a while and we will need to find the IP address to the newly started Pi. For this we will use nmap to search for the devices on the nettwork. Pi 3 starts with B8:27:EB as the MAC address while the Pi 4 uses dc:a6:32 . $ sudo nmap -sP 192 .168.10.0/24 Starting Nmap 7 .80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021 -04-21 18 :56 CEST Nmap scan report for ubuntu.home ( 192 .168.10.195 ) Host is up ( 0 .0038s latency ) . MAC Address: B8:27:EB:##:##:## ( Raspberry Pi Foundation ) Nmap done : 256 IP addresses ( 1 hosts up ) scanned in 0 .90 seconds After you got the IP address we can login by using the default user name ubuntu with the password ubuntu . Answear yes when the beeing asked to continue the connection. ssh ubuntu@192.168.10.195 Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes/no/ [ fingerprint ]) ? The first part of the login will be resetting the default password so first write ubuntu then your own new password to be used. First thing to do is update the OS by doing: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y Set Hostname To be able to give names to the Pis we will use the hostnamectl so that we can more easly get the hold of the Pis on the nettwork. In this setup we will name the Pis with swarm# where the # represents a number. Here we will setup 3 nodes so we will have the name swamr1 , swarm2 and swarm3 . To set the hostname use the following command: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname swarm1 then reboot the nodes after the change by: sudo reboot","title":"Raspberry Pi"},{"location":"docker-swarm/pi/#overview","text":"Here we will go thrue the process of setting up docker swarm on a Raspberry Pi, and joining multiple Pis to form a production grade swarm cluster.

We will describe it shortly here what to do. Start by installing needed packages if theyr are not allready installed: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release Add the official GPG key from docker: curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg Then do the following to add the stable repository from arm64: echo \"deb [arch=arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null Then install docker by doing: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Configure Swarm So we will now start to setup the swarm cluster where we will use swarm1 and swarm2 as managers. So lets start with swarm1 : sudo docker swarm init Swarm initialized: current node (y58ktz3t50hx9bf3vkfrllslp) is now a manager. To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command: docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3wtznqt1vd037sgq4qz2tgrmrmg7na7qfxn6lqay7bc5ud0omp-9zh7iba7zitvb2q78o10m3nw0 192.168.10.158:2377 To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions. As seen above we get an commando we can use to add worker nodes to the cluster, but we will firstly start by adding another manager and will use the command mention under the worker commando. sudo docker swarm join-token manager To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command: docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3wtznqt1vd037sgq4qz2tgrmrmg7na7qfxn6lqay7bc5ud0omp-33hoq3y8yvzob61y8c30t2goi 192.168.10.158:2377 We do as commanded and run that command on the swarm2 Pi. sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3wtznqt1vd037sgq4qz2tgrmrmg7na7qfxn6lqay7bc5ud0omp-33hoq3y8yvzob61y8c30t2goi 192.168.10.158:2377 This node joined a swarm as a manager. As a final joine we will add the last pi as a worker by using the command given when first initializing the swarm: sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3wtznqt1vd037sgq4qz2tgrmrmg7na7qfxn6lqay7bc5ud0omp-9zh7iba7zitvb2q78o10m3nw0 192.168.10.158:2377 This node joined a swarm as a worker. Add Workers If at a later time we would like to add more workers we can generate a new token so we do not need to save the token command given above. This can be done by running the following command to get a token: sudo docker swarm join-token worker First service As a way to control the docker swarm we will add a portainer this is a open source solution to control docker the swarm graphicaly.
